# Exercise 1: Content Ingestion & Index Creation

### Estimated Duration: 30 Minutes

## Overview

In this exercise, you will prepare your data foundation by uploading sample PDFs and images to Azure Blob Storage, and configuring Azure AI Search to ingest and process them. Using built-in OCR and text extraction capabilities, Azure AI Search will enrich the content and generate a searchable index. This indexed data will serve as the knowledge base for your chatbot, enabling grounded, document-aware responses in later exercises.

## Objectives

- Task 1: Define & Populate Search Index

## Task 1 : Define & Populate Search Index

## Summary

In this exercise, you prepared your data foundation by uploading sample PDFs and images to Azure Blob Storage and configuring Azure AI Search to ingest and process them. Using built-in OCR and text extraction capabilities, Azure AI Search enriched the content and generated a searchable index. This indexed data now serves as the knowledge base for your chatbot, enabling grounded, document-aware responses in later exercises.
